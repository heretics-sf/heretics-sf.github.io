## Concept

The files in this folder are scans of what appears to be paper prints from microfilm negatives of faded and damaged blueprints of the original drawings.

Despite the poor state of the blueprints there is much that can be learned and identified regarding Miss Morgan's good efforts.


## To Do / Wish List

* Files to be renamed from generic title to drawing-specific title
	* Note that original title of the drawing is often illegible
