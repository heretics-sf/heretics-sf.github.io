# Letter to my younger self

Dear Theo

Here are a bunch of vignettes on the joys of aging - all random thoughts off the top of my head. They could use some amplifying, but it's a start. The wake up call is that the first half of your life was well-planned, so how about some planning for the second half?

* The older you get, there more there are issues. Your aging process will not be special
* The clock in your brain starts to slow down, so time goes by faster
* Here ( see links below) are a hundred common ailments of the aged. How many will you have?
* The older you get, the more there are things you must do, you have no spare time
* 47 will be the most stressful year of your life. 83 the happiest year.
* As the numbers change so do you. Will you be OK living in your place at 65? At 75? At 85? 95?
* The best time to live your dream is before you die
* You know so many people, it becomes difficult to remember the name of the person you are with right now  
* The smart thing to do is to plan well before you get to be less smart
* Your family can do great things or they can look after you, but they can't do both
* Do not assume that someone will look after you
* You will not age any better than the others
* On average you will age average or below
* The longer you live, the more you outlive friends, family, drinking-buddies, devils-you-know, sorority sisters et al
* You will be just as clueless about aging as anybody else
* People don't get to be very old all by themselves
* The young have the abilities but are clueless. The aged have the clues and have disabilities. Overall, productivity stays the same
* The older you get the more you know what you like and don't like. Being happy gets to be easier and easier.
* Many people live by watching TV. Watching their favorite channels, they entertain themselves to death
* Adults make children go to school in order to learn how to grow up. But who teaches the adults how to grow better?
* Old people never tell you all the things they suffer from
* Old people never tell you their secrets
* Successful aging may be the ultimate challenge to a good life.

> Age, family genetics, and gender make it nearly impossible for older adults to avoid becoming a chronic disease statistic. Eighty percent of adults 65 and older have at least one condition, while 68% have two or more. You probably have a parent or grandparent who is managing a condition right now, or perhaps you are managing one yourself.

> Sixty two percent of Americans over 65 have more than one chronic condition (34) and the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions is increasing (35), due to aging of populations and to increasing diabetes rates.
