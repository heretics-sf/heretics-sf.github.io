# Letter to my younger self

Dear Theo

Here are a bunch of vignettes on the joys of aging - all random thoughts off the top of my head. They could use some amplifying, but it's a start. The wake up call is that the first half of your life was well-planned, so how about some planning for the second half?

## Sticks

* Old people never tell you all the things they suffer from
* Old people never tell you their secrets

So let's start spilling some of the beans. Very human beans.

* The older you get, there more there are issues. Your aging process will not be special
* The clock in your brain starts to slow down, so time goes by faster
* Here ( see links below) are a hundred common ailments of the aged. How many will you have?
* The older you get, the more there are things you must do, you have no spare time
* 47 will be the most stressful year of your life. 83 the happiest year.
* As the numbers change so do you. Will you be OK living in your place at 65? At 75? At 85? 95?
* The best time to live your dream is before you die
* You know so many people, it becomes difficult to remember the name of the person you are with right now  
* The smart thing to do is to plan well before you get to be less smart
* Your family can do great things or they can look after you, but they can't do both
* Do not assume that someone will look after you
* You will not age any better than the others
* On average you will age average or below
* The longer you live, the more you outlive friends, family, drinking-buddies, devils-you-know, sorority sisters et al
* You will be just as clueless about aging as anybody else
* People don't get to be very old all by themselves
* The young have the abilities but are clueless. The aged have the clues and have disabilities. Overall, productivity stays the same
* Many people live by watching TV. Watching their favorite channels, they entertain themselves to death
* Adults make children go to school in order to learn how to grow up. But who teaches the adults how to grow better?
* If you continue to eat what you eat now, you will not be what you need to eat when you are my age

## Carrots

For every negative, there is a positive. But the number of positives is smaller.

Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way; All happy families are alike;

* Successful aging may be the ultimate challenge to a good life.
* The older you get the more you know what you like and what you don't like. Being happy becomes easier and easier.
* If there are things you like doing - and you are one of the lucky ones - you will have the time and place to do that thing
* If you are old and productive and useful, you are what the world needs. You are what you were made for.


## Letter to my older self

Felicitations on having made it to 90. Given my evil ways, I never imagined you could get here.

Here is what I imagine got you here:

* Walk 5,000 steps a day - or some distance that you can track
* Establish maintain simple rules that you obey about food and drink
* Decide a time when anything goes. Life expectancy less than three years??
* Get a hearing aid and know how to use it
* Be able to walk with a walker, cane handrail and unassisted
* You have coaches for fitness, diet and health
* You are up to date with technology
* You have an engaged dialog with one or more people every day

> Age, family genetics, and gender make it nearly impossible for older adults to avoid becoming a chronic disease statistic. Eighty percent of adults 65 and older have at least one condition, while 68% have two or more. You probably have a parent or grandparent who is managing a condition right now, or perhaps you are managing one yourself.
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732407/

> Sixty two percent of Americans over 65 have more than one chronic condition (34) and the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions is increasing (35), due to aging of populations and to increasing diabetes rates.
