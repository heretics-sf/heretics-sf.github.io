# What is the meaning of the three roses?


On the front elevation of the Heritage, above both the first flooer bay windows to left and right, between the two sets of windows there are inset panels of _terra_ cotta tiles. Both panels display the same bas-reliefs: three roses surrounded by garlands with four raspberries.

## "As built" and "As designed"

In the photo:

* Each rose is composite of three nested roses
* There are eight petals with gaps between petals at the quadrants
* Surrounding the roses there is a garland composed with berries and leaves of a type not yet identified ( perhaps a shamrock?)

The photo above shows the terracotta tiles as visible in a recent photo.

The image of the drawing above shows the drawing from Julia Morgan's drawing in 1925.

In the drawing:

* Each rose is a single rose
* There are eight petals with petals at the quadrants split in two
* Between the roses there are sprays of acanthus leaves
* At the bottom of the panel there are garlands of simple leaves

There are a number of quite visible differences between drawing and photo

The photo depicts a final effort that is far more detailed than the drawing. This was often the custom, The architect and the artist who won the contract would discuss and agree details as the project was being built. The two parties would agree the best effort that could be made given the time, budget and skills of the artist.

## Craftsmanship

  Given the undercuts on the petals, it appears that the panels were case using a lost wax process. Alternatively the panels might have been pulled from a mold and the undercuts hand carved after. In any case, the work we see has been made by a highly skilled and informed craftsman with much hand work.

  What firm or craftsmen supplied the terra cotta panels here and elsewhere is a topic to be investigated.


## Symbology

We have all - one way or another - been informed by dictums of modern architecture such as "form follows function" and "less is more". We have lost much understanfing of the pre-modern eras of architecture where there was much decoration that was figurative or symbolic or both.

### Roses as symbols or Protestantism

In both cases, the roses have close resemblance to a [tudor rose]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_rose )

>The Tudor rose (sometimes called the Union rose) is the traditional floral heraldic emblem of England and takes its name and origins from the House of Tudor, which united the House of Lancaster and the House of York. The Tudor rose consists of five white inner petals, representing the House of York, and five red outer petals to represent the House of Lancaster.

The significant difference is that the tudor rose is twice five petals whereas the Heritage roses are 4, 12 and 8 petals.

### Raspberries as symbols of kindness

>Raspberries are seen as a symbol of kindness in Christian art. The red juice is thought of as blood
which runs through the heart, which is also believed to be the place where kindness originates.
Their delicate state in transport has led them to symbolize fragility as well.

>At the time, Mercer's work set off a flurry of tile artisanship across the country and particularly in California, where the equally influential Ernest Batchelder, an Arts and Crafts proponent, set up a kiln in his Pasadena backyard in 1909. His Batchelder Tile Co. prospered in the region's construction boom, and his earthy-looking tiles were perfect for the dark interiors of bungalows and Spanish Colonial homes going up at the time.
