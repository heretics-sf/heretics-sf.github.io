# What is the meaning of the three roses?


Gardner asks: When Julia Morgan designed The Heritage she added roses on the outside and inside of the building. We wonder why she did this.  Did she have a hidden meaning that is lost to us.  Or was the rose motif used to convey her feelings about the people who lived here?  Might roses have been a theme for benefactors whose finances helped build this fascinating building?   First we will describe where the roses are located and then, we hope in future articles, to try to explain why she used roses.

On the front elevation of the Heritage, above both the first floor bay windows to left and right, between the two sets of windows there are inset panels of _terra cotta_ tiles. Both panels display the same _bas-reliefs_: three roses surrounded by garlands or vines with four raspberries.



## "As designed" and "As built"

What did the architect dream of and what did the contractor actually get built? This is a metaphysical dialectic of sorts that is not a rare event in architecture. Here we live in a good example.

<img src="https://heritagesf.github.io/photos/1925-morgan-heritage/1925-morgan-heritage-west-elevation-three-roses.jpg" width=300 >

In the photo of the Heritage "as built":

* Each rose is composite of three nested roses
* There are eight petals with gaps between petals at the quadrants
* Surrounding the roses there is a garland oor vine composed with berries and leaves of a type not yet identified ( perhaps a shamrock?)
* The panel is composed of four unique components

The photo above shows the terracotta tiles as visible in a recent photo.

The image of the drawing above shows the "as designed" drawing from Julia Morgan's drawings drafted in 1925.


In the drawing:

* Each rose is a single rose
* There are eight petals with petals at the quadrants split in two
* Between the roses there are sprays of acanthus leaves
* At the bottom of the panel there are garlands of simple leaves
* The panel is composed of 12 components with a number of similarities




## Craftsmanship

Is the building the result of what the builder found at the lumber yard? Or do we have architecture a reminder of Vitruvius's dictum that architecture should be be "firm, commodious and delightful"? We can decide where to place a structure by looking at the craftsmanship in the project.

There are a number of quite visible differences between drawing and photo

The photo depicts a final effort that is far more detailed and more complex than the drawing. The phote depicts a work with a more complex crafting effort. This was often the custom, the architect and the artist who won the contract would discuss and agree details as the project was being built. The two parties would agree the best effort that could be made given the time, budget and skills of the artist.

Given the undercuts on the petals, it appears that the panels were case using a lost wax process. Alternatively the panels might have been pulled from a mold and the undercuts hand carved after. In any case, the work we see has been made by a highly skilled and informed craftsman with much hand work.

What firm or craftsmen supplied the terra cotta panels here and elsewhere is a topic to be investigated.


## Symbology in buildings

We have all - one way or another - been informed by dictums of modern architecture such as "form follows function" and "less is more". We moderns have lost much understanding of the pre-modern eras of architecture where there was much decoration that was figurative or symbolic or both.

For example, if you saw a sculpture of a man in a toga carrying a sword and a book you know you are looking at a depiction of Saint Paul. If there's a man with a foot resting on a dragon, you are looking at Saint George. If the man is tied up and shot with arrows, you are looking at Saint Sebastian.

In traditional building, everything means something.  Things are added to buildings because they means something for the inhabitants or whoever builds the building.

Therefore when we look at the panels we musk ask a series of questions

* What symbols are repeated through the project?
* What flowers are they?
* Why roses?
* Why three roses?
* Why three embedded roses?
* Why fruits or berries?
* Why raspberries?
* Why vines?
* Why thorns?
* Why single leaves and trefoils?
* What plant do the trefoils represent


### Repeated use of a symbol at the Heritage

A certain flower-like element is used repeatedly in multiple locations at the Heritage

* Flowers in panels
* Flowers in central panel
* Flowers in corbels
* Flowers in window architraves
* Flowers in front door arches
* Flowers in column capitals
* Flowers to sides of front bay corbels
* Flowers in chapel alter
* Flowers in parlor mantelpiece
* Flowers in brass ornaments on fireplace

To be added: photos of all of these

### What flower is it? A rose?

The significant difference is that the tudor rose is twice five petals whereas the Heritage roses are 4, 12 and 8 petals.


### Roses as love

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(symbolism)

> common meanings of different coloured roses are: True love (red), mystery (blue), innocence or purity (white), death (black), friendship (yellow), and passion (orange).

> Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary.

> The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.

> Since the 1880s, the red rose has been a symbol of socialism

### Three Roses

Why three roses?

> Three roses: The traditional three-month anniversary gift also simply means "I love you."

> 3 Roses – ‘I love you’.


### Double rose

### Roses as symbols or Protestantism

In both cases, the roses have close resemblance to a [tudor rose]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_rose )

>The Tudor rose (sometimes called the Union rose) is the traditional floral heraldic emblem of England and takes its name and origins from the House of Tudor, which united the House of Lancaster and the House of York. The Tudor rose consists of five white inner petals, representing the House of York, and five red outer petals to represent the House of Lancaster.

> The Luther seal or Luther rose is a widely recognized symbol for Lutheranism.

### Raspberries as symbols of kindness

* [Berries as Symbols and in Folklore]( https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.cornell.edu/dist/0/7265/files/2016/12/berryfolklore-2ljzt0q.pdf )

>Raspberries are seen as a symbol of kindness in Christian art. The red juice is thought of as blood
which runs through the heart, which is also believed to be the place where kindness originates.
Their delicate state in transport has led them to symbolize fragility as well.

### Trefoils

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock

> Traditionally, shamrock is said to have been used by Saint Patrick to illustrate the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity when Christianising Ireland in the 5th century. T

> The three leaves of a shamrock are also said to stand for faith, hope and love.

>At the time, Mercer's work set off a flurry of tile artisanship across the country and particularly in California, where the equally influential Ernest Batchelder, an Arts and Crafts proponent, set up a kiln in his Pasadena backyard in 1909. His Batchelder Tile Co. prospered in the region's construction boom, and his earthy-looking tiles were perfect for the dark interiors of bungalows and Spanish Colonial homes going up at the time.
