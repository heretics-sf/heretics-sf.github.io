The Grass

* American Grassfed Association (AGA) ~ https://www.americangrassfed.org/
> From the farm to the marketplace and in government policy, we support, advocate, and promote American grassfed and pasture-based farms and ranches.
>We do so by:
>Maintaining a credible, transparent national standard for animals humanely raised on pasture
>Partnering and collaborating to support rural economies
* www.grassfedexchange.com
> The Grassfed Exchange is a coordinated effort of producers and buyers of grassfed genetics that come together to form the Grassfed Exchange Committee. It is our desire to provide a means of education and exchange of grassfed genetics between producers. With quite a few conferences behind us that have been well received, we continue to promote the grassfed industry and grassfed genetics through education and display.
