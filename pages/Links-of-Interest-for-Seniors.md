## Aging

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing
>Ageing or aging (see spelling differences) is the process of becoming older. The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, perennial plants and some simple animals are potentially biologically immortal. In the broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing (cellular senescence) or to the population of a species (population ageing).
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion
>The end-of-history illusion is a psychological illusion in which individuals of all ages believe that they have experienced significant personal growth and changes in tastes up to the present moment, but will not substantially grow or mature in the future. Despite recognizing that their perceptions have evolved, individuals predict that their perceptions will remain roughly the same in the future.

>Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults.

## Gerontology

> Gerontology is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of aging.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_gerontology
> Financial Gerontology is a multidisciplinary field of study encompassing both academic and professional education, that integrates research on aging and human development with the concerns of finance and business.
> In particular, research and teaching in financial gerontology draws upon four kinds of aging or "'four lenses" through which aging and finance can be viewed: population aging, individual aging, family aging, and generational aging

* https://www.ncoa.org/blog/10-common-chronic-diseases-prevention-tips/
> Age, family genetics, and gender make it nearly impossible for older adults to avoid becoming a chronic disease statistic. Eighty percent of adults 65 and older have at least one condition, while 68% have two or more. You probably have a parent or grandparent who is managing a condition right now, or perhaps you are managing one yourself.
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732407/

> Sixty two percent of Americans over 65 have more than one chronic condition (34) and the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions is increasing (35), due to aging of populations and to increasing diabetes rates.
