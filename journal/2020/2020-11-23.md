## COVID-19 Heads Up

The census tract for the Heritage is now a San Francisco COVID-19 hotspot.

I am concerned about the residents and Thanksgiving outings. I am planning to self-isolate in some way. I may go down to the dining room and pick up food to bring back to my apartment from Thursday until Sunday.

I have just ordered 2 KN95 masks

* Walking fast helps you last (live longer)
