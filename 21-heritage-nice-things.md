# 21 Nice Things About the Heritage

I am an architect, designer and software programmer. I observe, decide and tabulate many aspects of my life.

Over the past decade I have considered the issues of being an aging, disabled single person.

The following is a short summary of observations gathered since I moved to the Heritage on August 5, 2020

There are three sections: Premises, community, support & services - with seven bullet points each

## Premises

### Introduction

### 1. "Location location location"

* [‘There are three things that matter in property: location, location, location.’]( https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/magazine/28FOB-onlanguage-t.html )
* Guess what? the Heritage has all three!
	1. Very high [walkability( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkability ): [Walk score]( https://www.walkscore.com/score/3400-laguna-st-san-francisco-ca-94123 )
	2. A nearby apple store ~ Apple picks locations judiciously, just three in SF
	3. All age-groups, ethnicities, rich  and not so rich live in the neighborhood


### 2. "My Father's house has many mansions" - John 14:2 KJV

* Many old people live in small places without much. And a good number live in large abodes but use only a small portion. And others, whatever the size, lack amenities they would like. Life at the Heritage provides access to living rooms, kitchens, pianos, art studios, treatment rooms and salons. It's a huge place, with a many facilities and you get to decide the parts you want to use.

### 3. "How does your garden grow?" ~ Gardens and Landscaping

Remember
* Multiple entrances on three sides of the property
* Flowers at your fingertips
* Gardens and landscaping in all sides of the premises
* Gardens on every terrace on every floor

* Many people live in places surrounded by fences and parking lots, paving stones and manhole covers - all occasionally accented by rectangles of grass and some bushes. Life at the Marina is to live surrounded on three sides by seven flower gardens and terraces, playing fields and a national park - with views of the Bay, mountains and hundreds of trees - all in middle of the city noted for its beauty.

### 4. Neighborhood & Walking

* Entrances on three sides of the property enable multiple walking routes right from the start

* Life in the Heritage is living in a place that has reinvented itself continuously since 1853. From technologies like emergency buttons and WiFi to outsourced catering and earthquake retro-fitting the Heritage is a living, self-improving creation. And one of the Great reinventions was asking Julia Morgan to design the premises on Laguna Street. Life at the Heritage means you walk in beauty every day.

### 7. Security of place ~

* Old people die from accidents. Accidents caused by being fall risks, by being hoarders, by being easily distracted, by living alone.

## Community


### 1. Your 100 best friends - always

* Life at the Heritage means you always have a hundred or so friends. As the older ones go their places are taken by fresh new ones.


### 2. Every walk of life ~ get outside of your bubble

* As you get older and older you get out and travel around less. The people you see are increasingly of a small bubble of people with similar backgrounds.

### 3. local administration with community values
* Landlords, homeowners associations and all the organizations associated with living in a neighborhood are there primarily to protect, promote and profit the premises
* People making the long term decisions work in the building

## Support and Services

### 1. Varying needs ~ flexible care model

* Independent living, assisted living, dementia care and skilled nursing
For many old people good health is a variable, They are fine some times and need a hip replaced other times. Therefore the level of assistance they may need is equally variable. Managing these needs becomes a complex issue in itself. Life at the Heritage means that there are staff competent in a wide variety of issues who can pitch in as and when needed.


### 2. You are what you eat ~ Balance diet
* Shopping for groceries and preparing meals does not get any easier as you grow older. Many old people survive on unbalanced and highly repetitive meals. Life at the heritage is about selecting from a choice of nutritionist-designed, chef-prepared menu of tasty treats.


### 3. Keeping House and DIY ~ Housekeeping & Maintenance
* Washing floors, picking up after spills, fixing broken things are not much fun even when you are young. They can be a pain when you are old. Life at the Heritage means always living in a clean apartment with freshly laundered lines. The soap dispenser always has soap. The ceiling lights always work and the taps never leak. The garbage is always taken out. The grass is always green. All of this happens because there are competent and dedicated staff to make this happen


### 4. Talking about communicating ~ IT
* "My Internet is down", "The fire alarm did not sound", "He lay on the floor of the bathroom for three days before help arrived". Information technology (IT) support is an essential ingredient of modern life. Life at the Heritage means there is secure, high-speed Internet available via WiFi through the premises and gardens, fire alarms and smoke detectors are tested frequently, emergency buttons and intercoms enable staff and residents to communicate with a click of button.


### 5. Health issues: prevention and treatment ~ nursing and well-being

Life at the Heritage means having access to nursing staff and therapists on the premises 24/7. It also means being able to participate in activities such as Yoga, solving puzzles, attending lectures, going on outings and more.


### 6. Security
* Security and nursing 24/7, people preparing food and serving 21 meals a week, emergency generators with three day supply of fuel. Resident well-being is checked every day - in multiple ways - from appearing at meals, to housekeeping, to door checks


### 7. "Surprise!!" ~ "Who ya going to call?" ~ Pandemic management
* Taking care of the elderly requires steadfast management that ensure a high level of care day after day. Letting the ball drop even for a day or two can mean death or injury. At the same time natural calamities occur, politics change and sxxx his the fan.

This means that residents, staff and especially management were able to cope with a huge surprise.
