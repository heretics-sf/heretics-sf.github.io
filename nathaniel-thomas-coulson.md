## Grace Cathedral Carillon

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Cathedral,_San_Francisco#Carillon

> The carillon was the gift of Nathaniel T. Coulson, a San Francisco dentist and realtor who came from Lostwithiel in Cornwall. When Coulson first arrived in San Francisco in 1875, he found his way to Grace Church, which lacked a bell tower. Although a Methodist, he vowed to provide bells for the church and eventually spent his life savings to realize his dream and to erect the Singing (north) Tower to house them. The carillon consists of forty-four bronze bells, cast and tuned at the Gillett & Johnston Foundry of Croydon, England, in 1938. The bells arrived before the cathedral tower was completed, so they spent their first years on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay as the centerpiece of the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition. The carillon was first played from its Singing Tower home on Christmas Eve, 1940, and was formally dedicated in 1943. The bells have been rung to mark a number of important events, including D-Day and the centenary of the San Francisco cable car system.


## Grace Cathedral Bells and Specification

> Grace Cathedral’s bell carillon was the gift of Dr. Nathaniel T. Coulson (1853-1945), a British-born orphan and seaman, become San Francisco dentist and investor. Coulson gave his fortune to build the north or Singing Tower of the cathedral (1939-1941), and to supply it with a carillon of forty-four bronze bells from the Gillet and Johnston bell foundry in Croydon, England (cast 1937-1938). During his last years he lived on a dollar a day to realize his goal. He lived to see the tower and carillon dedicated by Dean Thomas Wright in 1943. Coulson wanted his ashes be placed in the tower crypt, but his wish was delayed. In 1990, on the fiftieth anniversary of the bell installation, his ashes were moved from nearby Cypress Lawn columbarium to the new cathedral columbarium, located below his carillon, in his own Singing Tower
