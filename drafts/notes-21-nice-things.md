## First Principles

When you are looking at something first time and you want to understand what you are seeing.

A good place to start is at the beginning.

A good first question is: where does it begin?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle
* https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/
* https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover

Finding that first answer can take until the end of time.

So let's establish a trick or three.

We are going to search all over the place for likely answers as "Where is the beginning?", "What is going on here?"

There must be more than one likely candidate as where to begin. If not we would alread to be there.

If there are just two places then we have to start dividing them up to see which is the best. If there are many places then we  have to start combing them in order to see where to start.

Therefore always assume there are three ⛬ 3 good places to start.

## Famous triads

It turns out that dividing a topic into three is quite common.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotomy_(philosophy)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-way_comparison << threeway comparison mey be easier
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory << competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

* A commonly used triad is: doing, knowing and being
* Or: acting, judging, knowing
* Our triad here: services, community, premises
* Services: the staff do things, there are activities
* Community: people judging, liking each other
* Premises: people knowing their way around, things you can see, evidence

## Premises

### Notes

* Remember Vitruvius on Architecture: Firmness, Commodity, and Delight"
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_architectura


### 1. "Location location location" ~ region and city

San Francisco is a top tourist destination ~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_attractions_in_the_United_States
* Best place to live: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/15/us-news-world-report-best-places-to-live-in-the-us-in-2019.html

The third could be any of the following

* Outside walking
* Clean air
* Can hear the seals ( and fog horns )
* Nature
* Trendy 'hood
* Flat, sloping and steep walking terrain
* Excellent shopping streets nearby within walking distance

### 2. Neighborhood

* The point of cities is multiplicity of choice. Jane Jacobs
* In our American cities, we need all kinds of diversity. Jane Jacobs
* By its nature, the metropolis provides what otherwise could be given only by traveling; namely, the strange. Jane Jacobs
* The more successfully a city mingles everyday diversity of uses and users in its everyday streets, the more successfully, casually (and economically) its people thereby enliven and support well-located parks that can thus give back grace and delight to their neighborhoods instead of vacuity. Jane Jacobs

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Mr Rogers

* Architecture, services, landscape, geography, demographics, social studies, planning, infrastructure


### 6. "Walk in beauty" ~ Aesthetics



* My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone. Jilia Morgan
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Morgan

* “Any great art work … revives and readapts time and space, and the measure of its success is the extent to which it makes you an inhabitant of that world - the extent to which it invites you in and lets you breathe its strange, special air.” ― Leonard Bernstein
* When love and skill work together expect a masterpiece. (John Ruskin)


### 7. security

* It's not going to fall down
* It's not going to leak
* When it leaks, freezes, burns, bed bugs attack, the drains get clogged, the fire alarm goes off you do not have to deal with it
* Mildew, rot, termites, rats, ants, skunks
* Washing windows, cleaning carpets, painting walls, hanging pictures
* It does it's best to keep you safe
* It's not going to injure you
* It will be here tomorrow
* It will bring joy today and tomorrow
* It will keep you "connected"
* Given fire, earthquake, pestilence whatever your protection will be second to none
* All you have to do is pull down the shades, shot off the water and turn off the lights
* the developers are not going to tear it down
* It's unlikely to be condemned, burned down or flooded - much less likely than a private home

	* Study 1: four factors consistently show up as community attributes we all look for in a good community.
		* Membership - that feeling that part of us is invested in the community, that we have a right to belong and feel welcome
		* Influence - that sense that we have some say in the community issues that affect us and that our perspectives are appreciated and respected
		* Integration and fulfillment of needs - based on the notion that the community has numerous opportunities for both individual and social fulfillment including basic needs, recreation, and social interaction. Some scholars have referred to this as the meeting the needs of 'whole person' in all our roles, (e.g. goods, services, recreation, desirable social interaction activities etc.)
