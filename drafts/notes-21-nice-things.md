## First Principles

When you are looking at something first time and you want to understand what you are seeing.

A good place to start is at the beginning.

A good first question is: where does it begin?

* https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/
* https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover

Finding that first answer can take until the end of time.

So let's establish a trick or three.

We are going to search all over the place for likely answers as "Where is the beginning?", "What is going on here?"

There must be more than one likely candidate as where to begin. If not we would alread to be there.

If there are just two places then we have to start dividing them up to see which is the best. If there are many places then we  have to start combing them in order to see where to start.

Therefore always assume there are three ⛬ 3 good places to start.

## Famous triads

It turns out that dividing a topic into three is quite common.

* Premises: people knowing their way around, things you can see, evidence

		* Membership - that feeling that part of us is invested in the community, that we have a right to belong and feel welcome
		* Influence - that sense that we have some say in the community issues that affect us and that our perspectives are appreciated and respected
		* Integration and fulfillment of needs - based on the notion that the community has numerous opportunities for both individual and social fulfillment including basic needs, recreation, and social interaction.
