1. Deliverable: An online presence where residents, staff, family and friends access resident-related data and tools that may be public or private via phone, tablet or computer

2. Mission: provide reference material to residents in ways that speed up delivery time, reduce paperwork, increase productivity wia pretty, easy to use tools

3. Vision: Residents are more engaged, aware and active because what they need to know or remember is always available at their fingertips

4. Craftspersonship: The presence is secure, defensible, disabled-friendly, end-user maintainable, search-engine friendly, built using open-source tools & revision control and hosted with free long-term maintainability in mind.

5. Repleteness: The presence supports a number of tools including a content management system, mailing lists, forum, gallery, simple database along with dashboard and admin capabilities

6. Managed: The development process should be slow and steady. First running in parallel with current systems such as duplicating the data on the closed circuit TV channel, material distributed vie paper dropped in mailboxes and material already on the web that is not normally available to residents

7. Material available in early version might include the monthly issues of the Happenings, re-posts of the Heritage Facebook, Twitter & LinkedIn posts, food-service menus and nutrients data. forms that need filling such as vaccinations, phone & email directory

8. Later: bios, photos, maps and floor plans, activities such the word games and news, access to books and news, integration with the library tools improve the Heritage

9. Ownership: The residents feel that it is their web-presence. Much like the current Happenings, the Residents web presence is quasi-independent of the Heritage and protected via a mutual respect for the other

11: Benevolence: The successes and failures of the Heritage web presence are shared with retirement communities
