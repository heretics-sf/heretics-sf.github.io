We are all students of history - more or less - but very few of us have "made history".

On the other hand, few of us are students of the history of our own lives.

From time to time, we do break the barrier and connect ourselves to history.

The death of RGB reminded Midge that her husband was photographed with RGB at the moment RGB played a role in one of the operas he produced. The December happenings includes a photo oh EC.

"History is an attempt These are memories and, as such, are necessarily subjective, heading port most histories like calling his sense of what it was like to live at another time and what it meant."

The precious thing is the moment when somebody pauses and takes a decision to record and preserve a connection to history. The history of a history may be as fascinating as the history itself.

A terrible book that is joyfully readable. A litany of logical contradictions that may make sense.

A self-serving rehash of random diary entries that make you smile.
