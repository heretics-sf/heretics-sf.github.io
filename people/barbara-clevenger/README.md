## Concept

First Paragraph of the text

> This is a paper written on a Julia Morgan house listed in Sarah Boutelle’s book, “Julia Morgan, Architect” 1995 edition on page 252, Morgan Job No. 345, Oakland Building Permit 25014 of August 21, I908. The address
listed is: 1524-29th Avenue, Oakland, CA . Twenty-ninth avenue is an extension of Park Street in the city of Alameda--driving due east on Park you cross the Park Street Bridge over the Estuary and it turns into 29th
Avenue, progressing through Kennedy Tract, crossing East 14th Street (where the house resides in the middle of the block) and terminates at 17th Street where it meets Hawthorne Elementary School. Also note
references to it in Mark Wilson’s “Living Legacy, Architecture in the East Bay.”
