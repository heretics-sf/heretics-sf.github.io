The California Voter’s Choice Act is a new law (PDF) passed in 2016 that will modernize elections in California by allowing counties to conduct elections under a new model which provides greater flexibility and convenience for voters.
This new election model allows voters to choose how, when, and where to cast their ballot by:
* Mailing every voter a ballot
* Expanding in-person early voting
* Allowing voters to cast a ballot at any vote center within their county
